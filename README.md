This project is not finished. 

TO DO
1) If testing shows current commands move the robot as expected:
    Make a model in Solidworks that will be 3D printed and mounted on claw arm to push robot onto back wheels
    Add new movements to pop a wheelie and find motor pct to ride on back wheels
2) If testing shows current commands do not move the robot as expected:
    Tweak commands according to problems found during testing
    Consider using rpm if no deg, pct commands result in wanted behavior
    
3) Once autonomous movement acts as desired, consider new functionality for user control/autonomous sections
    Possible UserControl: Remap ArmMotor and ClawMotor buttons to improve driver experience
    Possible Autonomous: Incorporate new sensor to detect lines on field and move accordingly, 
                         perhaps follow the lines around the field in a wheelie
